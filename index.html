        <p> I like my hobby because i's really funny to try to identify with the characters of the book and to imagine the environment. I think reading develops the brain and gives you the ability to understand other people. Besides, you develop your language if you read a lot because you learn new words all the time.To begin with it's very relaxing. You can sit down at a quiet place and just forget about the world
            around you for a while. Sometimes when I feel like I have a million things to do I take a
            break, make a cup of tea and cuddle up in the corner of the sofa with a good book. After just a little
            while of reading I've got my strength up to take care of everything. It's also a great way to calm down
            before going to bed.
            Secondly you can bring a book with you almost everywhere. It doesn't matter if youâ€™re on the subway,
            on the bus, on the beach or on a journey. There's always room for a book in the bag.
            Another good thing is that the way to school feels so much shorter if you have a book to read on the
            subwayAs such I really like it.
